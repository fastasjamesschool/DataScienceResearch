# Weekly 4/12/23 to 4/26/23
## 4/12/23 - 4/26/
These two weeks are quite strenous and the work I have done has been moving in leaps and bounds.  
I continued to build a knowledge and cheatsheet on MongoDB.  
I also started to learn and utilize Apache Spark. Even better is I have a class in which using Apache Spark will make my life a lot easier. I have to cleanse multiple datasets and using spark is the best way to go about it.  
So with that I started learning about Apache Spark from my own research and viewing curriculum provided my Dr.Dancik
Dancik Quote of the Biweekly update  
"“I’m from New Jersey, so we have lots of pride when it comes to him,” he said. “It’s a shame he won’t be performing.”"(In reference to Bon Jovi not making an appearance)
