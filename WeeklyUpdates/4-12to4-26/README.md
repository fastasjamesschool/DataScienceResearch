# Weekly 4/12/23 to 4/26/23
## 4/12/23 - 4/26/
These two weeks are quite strenuous and the work I have done has been moving in leaps and bounds. 
I continued to build a knowledge and cheat sheet on MongoDB. 
I also started to learn and utilize Apache Spark. Even better is I have a class in which using Apache Spark will make my life a lot easier. I have to cleanse multiple datasets and using spark is the best way to go about it. 
So with that I started learning about Apache Spark from my own research and viewing curriculum provided my Dr. Dancik 
I also started to prepare my final presentation for this research and read the **Strict** rules that were set. I was amused to see that I do have my own rule though!
Dancik Quote of the Biweekly update 
"“I’m from New Jersey, so we have lots of pride when it comes to him,” he said. “It’s a shame he won’t be performing.”"(In reference to Bon Jovi not making an appearance)
