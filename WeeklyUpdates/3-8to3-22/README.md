# Biweekly 3/8/23 to 3/22/23  
This part of the project was delayed due to midterms and working on documentation for my job I am soon leaving, so this will be a shortened report.  
First things off, I had to research what Mongodb is and I utilized w3 schools to learn NoSQL.  
Then I learned how MongoDB works essentially supplementing tables and rows from SQL as to what I'm used to, with Collections and Documents.   There are many differences between the two but really nailing down these basic concepts was essential to this portion of the research.  
I then started using the MongoDB Docker Image available and setting up the MongoDB extension to work on the Database.  
I successfully connected to the database and started to explore MongoDB.
